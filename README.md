Want to write more robust, maintainable code? In this course, discover how this can be accomplished with functional programming, and learn about the functional concepts at the heart of many JavaScript frameworks and programs. Functional programming is a radically different way of writing code. While at first it may seem a bit counterintuitive, once you get comfortable with it, you may find that your code becomes much easier to maintain, as well as more performant. This course aims to teach you everything you need to know to start taking advantage of the incredible power of functional programming in your own code, starting with the basics and going all the way up to more advanced concepts such as recursion, partial application, currying, and more.

Learning objectives
  - Understand and apply the core concepts of functional programming.
  - Use first-class functions to improve the readability and flexibility of your code.
  - Manipulate array and object data using JavaScript's built-in functional utilities.
  - Take your functional programming knowledge to the next level with advanced concepts such as partial application, recursion, and memoization.
